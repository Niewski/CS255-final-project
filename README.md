# DriverPass System Design Project
## Project Summary
DriverPass is a company that helps students prepare for their driving tests. They needed a web-based system for students to register, schedule driving lessons, take practice tests, and track progress. The system also supports staff with role-based access to manage users, appointments, and reports​.

## What Went Well
I clearly mapped system features to user roles, making sure that students, secretaries, IT officers, and administrators all had the tools they needed. I kept the design focused on real workflows described by the client.

## What I Would Improve
I would improve the flexibility of training package management. Right now packages can be enabled or disabled, but full editing still needs developer work. Adding a user-friendly management tool would make the system even better.

## Meeting User Needs
I made sure the system matched what DriverPass needed, like online lesson booking, role-based permissions, and DMV update integration. Building around user needs ensures the system is useful and easy for staff and customers.

## My Approach
I started with detailed requirements, then created use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams​. In the future I’ll continue using both object and process modeling, and will gather early feedback to catch improvements faster​.
